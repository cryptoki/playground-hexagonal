# Hexagonal Architecture

A kotlin and spring boot playground to a speech/workshop 
"Hexagonal Architecture / Ports & Adapters and Domain Driven Design DDD"
from december 2019. 

The knowledge based on the experience from different project and different flavour of the
'hexagonal' interpretation from different teams.

I tried to focused on the naming and the structuring of the source. 


The slides of the workshop are internal. I need to prepare new one.
