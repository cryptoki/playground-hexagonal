# Hexagonal Architecture

A kotlin and spring boot playground to speech / workshop. The knowledge based
on the experience from different project and different flavour of the
'hexagonal' interpretation from different teams.

I tried to focused on the naming and the structuring of the source. 

The slides of the workshop are internal. I need to prepare new one.
